## Description
This website is a sample of the HTML & CSS skills I learned at Coder Academy Web Dev bootcamp. The website content is a basic example of a portfolio. It shows a Home page as the landing page and links to About, Contact, and Projects pages. The projects page is a blog page with some posts. It is built as an assignment for the course.
